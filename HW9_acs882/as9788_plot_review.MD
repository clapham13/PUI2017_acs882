ASSIGNMENT
The data describe available rooftop space for solar from LiDAR data collected for New York City for a subset of buildings.

Because the data set includes latitude and longitude (location), a map based visualization might be useful for a policy maker

or community group interested in selecting a site. The open data site already offers a map of all the locations in this data set.

So in order to differentiate, I selected to map the points in various sizes tied to the estimated roof solar capacity in kw.

In addition to varying point size, I also elected to use a heavier color for denser concentration of points so that it's easier to differentiate.

The idea being that at first glance, one might see where is the greatest concentration of available rooftoop space ordered by solar capacity.

Enjoy!

N.B. The data was gathered here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/NYCHA-Public-Purpose-Shared-Solar-Opportunities/gbgg-xjuf

and plotted using Carto here: https://as9788.carto.com/builder/32f70005-32ce-4e75-8574-3e08a26e7a66

REVIEW

CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
