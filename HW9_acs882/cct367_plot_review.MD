REVIEW

CLARITY:
Despite it's apparent simplicity, this plot leaves me with a lot of questions. It's a line plot of temperature and humidity throughout the course of a day. It seems to be an aggregate of a number of days (judging by the y-axis label of 'sample mean'), but we do not know which days, nor how many. The 'sample mean' on the y-axis does not have units, so we don't know what it means! Is temperature in Farenheit or Celcius? Is this even temperature? Surely humidity isn't being measure in Kelvin units, and temperature in percent humidity. I just don't know what is being measured and how from this graphic. There is also no indication of where this data is from. Is this New York? Singapore? The South Pole? It is not apparent.

ESTHETIC:
I would recommend not using dots on each hour, as there's nothing particularly important about that specific point in time - it's the general trends that should be emphasized. To compensate for this (and make it more esthetically appealing), I would use a smaller tick-mark ratio on the x-axis - maybe every three hours? Two or four could work as well, but every five hours is too dispersed, and does not divide evenly into 24, so you get a weird cut-off at the end. 

HONESTY: 
If there is a dishonesty in this plot, it lies (no pun intended!) in what I mentioned earlier regarding the units on the y-axis. It tries to present two things as comparable, which may not be (or may be, but it is not clear to me by what is presented here that they are, at least in this format). 

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
I think the above outlines the major improvements that are needed. As an avid runner who prefers running in cool, dry air, I could use this plot to help determine what time of day is generally best to go for a run; while I can't decipher that from the chart given, it seems like there is plenty of potential to make this into an interesting, informative graphic!

Hope this is helpful!!!
