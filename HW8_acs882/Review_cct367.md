**Plot**

![MacDown Screenshot](https://github.com/clapham13/PUI2017_acs882/blob/master/HW8_acs882/data_viz.png?raw=true)

**CLARITY**: __is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?__

I can not easily interpret the number of plot, and not sure which area it is.

**ESTHETIC**: __beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?__


I was a little confuse by the plot, and can not easily get the information from this plot.


**HONESTY**: __is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?__

I think the data is not being deforming.


**IMPROVEMENTS TO PLOT**

Add on the 

1. date period, 
2. location on behind the plot.

Can make the caption shorter to read.
